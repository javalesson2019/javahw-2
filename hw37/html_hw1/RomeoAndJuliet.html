  <h1 class="center color">Romeo and Juliet</h1>
  <h2 class="color">ACT I</h2>
  <h2 class="color">PROLOGUE</h2>
  Two households, both alike in dignity,<br />
  In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br />
  From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br />
  Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br />
  From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br />
  A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br />
  Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br />
  Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br />
  The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br />
  And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br />
  Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br />
  Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br />
  The which if you with patient ears attend,<br />
  What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br />
  <h2 class="color">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h2>
  <span class="italic-text">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</span>
  <h2 class="color">SAMPSON</h2>
  Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
  <h2 class="color">GREGORY</h2>
  No, for then we should be colliers.
